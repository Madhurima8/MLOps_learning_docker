# MLOps_learning_docker
This repository is created as part of my hands-on learning journey with Docker. The example is taken from the YouTube video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeVZ6QcUb7Q&amp;list=PLupK5DK91flV45dkPXyGViMLtHadRr6sp&amp;index=9

All credit for the original material goes to the author of the tutorial.

I have used this code to practice, experiment, and document my understanding of Docker. Any modifications or notes I add here reflect my own learning process.
